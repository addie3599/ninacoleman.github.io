<h1> Biography </h1>

<P> 	        I come from a big Catholic family, 5 brothers and sisters. We all grew up in Catholic school; for high school I went to Saint Vincent's Academy. 
I have a twin brother, his name is Jack; he looks absolutely nothing like me. He is definitely my favorite sibling though because he is always willing to listen to me, on my toughest days when I need to talk to someone. 
 My parents are also wonderful, my mother is a stay- at- home mom and my dad owns our family business (construction). My siblings and I had a pretty great childhood. My parents always took time away from their own lives to spend it with us. 
 We were always put first in their eyes, even when we did not always appreciate it.
 The most memorable part of my childhood was how many pets my mother let us have. We have had dogs, cats, chickens, frogs, turtles, hamsters, rabbits, a squirrel, and much more.
 I will always remember how awesome my parents were to put up with 5 kids and 1000 animals. </P> 
<h1> My Best Accomplishment </h1>
<P> When I was a Junior in high school, I decided I was tired of being a typical cheerleader on a competitive cheerleading squad and decided I needed something more.
I had seen at many competitions that there were some teams who had girls with special needs. I always admired those cheerleaders so much, for their courage and positivity.
I decided I was going to start a cheerleading squad for girls with special needs at my own home gym. Finally, with the huge help of my cheerleading coach, my mom and my sister (who also helped coach the squad), the team was made and ready to start the season. 
At first it was very hard teaching girls with all kinds of disabilities, but eventually I learned what helped them learn. 
It was the greatest lesson of my life and one of the most fun times of my life; I would do it again in a heartbeat. </P>
 <h1> Why I Love My School </h1>
 <P> I love my school, The University of Georgia, for many reasons. The first is that it has helped me grow so much as a person. I was always a shy, quiet girl who never really spoke much or did much except for with my small group of friends at my small high school. 
  I came to UGA with no one I knew, so it forced me to come out of my shell and meet new people and make new memories. I am a much more confident person than I was when I was in high school. Another reason why I love my school is because it has challenged me academically. 
 UGA has taught me that if you want to succeed and graduate you HAVE to study. The biggest reason I love the University of Georgia is because it brought me my best friends, they are the reason why I call Athens, "Home". </P>
